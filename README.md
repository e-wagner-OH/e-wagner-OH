- 👋 Hi, I’m Eric Wagner (@e-wagner-OH)
- 👀 I’m interested in teaching, enterprise architecture, cooking, and staying in shape.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning much about enterprise architecture and bridging the gaps between the business and tech side.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything.
- 📫 How to reach me eric.wagner@ohiohealth.com

I report to Scott Zigler and am specializing in infrastructure enterprise architecture. In past roles at OSU, I was heavily focused on cloud native application tooling and deployments. I have a part-time job teaching cloud automation (docker --> kubernetes --> helm charts --> CI/CD) at Columbus State Community College.
